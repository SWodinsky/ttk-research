1. What is store rating?

  Store Score, formerly known as Store Experience Score (SES), is a ranking score introduced by TikTok Shop that helps sellers gain an in-depth understanding of store operation performance. Store ratings range from 0 to 5 and are calculated based on the seller's average store performance over the past 90 calendar days.
    The function of store rating is as follows:
    Provide sellers with an overall picture of store performance and buyer satisfaction.
    Help sellers identify key areas of store performance that may need improvement (such as shipping product reviews).
    Allow sellers to compare among similar sellers and help sellers improve their service levels.
    Provide buyers with transparency into how a store performs among similar stores.
    Help TikTok Shop evaluate star store badges to obtain qualifications.

  Please note that store ratings will only be displayed if the store meets the following criteria:
  Completed at least 30 orders in the past 90 calendar days
  There are no false orders


2. How does TikTok calculate store ratings?

  Store ratings are calculated based on the following performance metrics:
    a) product satisfaction: includes an evaluation of the seller’s negative review rate and the refund rate for returns that are not the buyer’s responsibility.    
    b) Negative Review Rate (NRR)
    c) Non-Buyer Responsible Return Refund Rate (NBFR)
    d) Fulfillment and Logistics: includes an assessment of cancellation rates and delayed fulfillment rates.    
    e) Business Responsibility Cancellation Rate (SFCR)
    f) Late Delivery Rate (LDR)
    g) customer service: includes an evaluation of buyer complaint rates and 24-hour response rates.
    h) Buyer Complaint Rate (CCR)
    i) 24 hour response rate
