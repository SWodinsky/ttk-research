** THIS IS ALL MY OWN THEORY / RESEARCH. PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY OF THIS FOR GOSPEL**

Sample formula based documents + links written by TikTok for domestic/cross-border sellers targeting US shoppers. 
Note that the _actual_ equation likely includes metrics that TikTok doesn't disclose publically. I supplemented TikTok's docs with these indenpendent reports from sellers on Zhihu who (allegedly) reverse engineered the score:

I'm also assuming the score calculation is analogous to Douyin's store rating model (DSR), which has been thoroughly analyzed and corroborated by people working at Byte/Douyin since its inception in 2020. I've translated these docs on DSR as part of my analysis:

TikTok notes that SPS is a score given out of 5. A seller with SPS = 4/5 is performing better than 80% of other sellers targeting the US

Shop Performance Score (SPS) is calculated based on the following performance metrics:
Product Satisfaction
Negative Review Rate (NRR)
Non-Buyer Fault Return and Refund Rate (NBFR)
Fulfillment and Logistics
Seller Fault Cancellation Rate (SFCR)
Late Dispatch Rate (LDR)
Customer Service
Customer Complaint Rate (CCR) 
24-hour Response Rate
