1. In docs for American sellers targeting US audiences, TikTok notes that Shop Performance Score (SPS) is a score given out of 5. A seller with SPS = 4/5 is performing better than 80% of other sellers targeting the US, and so on. 
   This calculation, per TikTok's docs, are based on 3 factors of a shopper's's overall experience with a given seller during the past 30 days:
      a. "Product Satisfaction"
      b. "Fulfillment and Logistics"
      c. "Customer Service"

   Each of these factors is then further broken down into their own independently calculated metrics:
      a. "Product Satisfaction" is comprised of a store's
         - Negative Review Rate (NRR)
         - Non-Buyer Fault Return and Refund Rate (NBFR)
      b. "Fulfillment and Logistics" is comprised of a store's
         - Seller Fault Cancellation Rate (SFCR)
         - Late Dispatch Rate (LDR)
      c. "Customer Service" is comprised of a store's
         - Customer Complaint Rate (CCR) 
         - 24-hour Response Rate

These factors are identical to the rating system used for scoring sellers based in Mainland China operating domestically (reaching Chinese shoppers) _and_ cross-border (reaching American shoppers).
While American-facing documentation doesn't list the weight each of these factors has in determining a seller's overall SPS, the Chinese documentation goes into further detail--the one difference is that these scores are multiplied by 20, giving a total SPS of 100 instead of 5.

These same documents also state that each merchant starts with a baseline score of 50/100. Assuming the rules are analogous for American sellers, each one would start with a 2.5/5 rating -- based on the same formula as its Chinese counterpart, just multiplied by 0.025. 
   ** IMPORTANT NOTE: My own formula doesn't *exactly* add up with the math in TikTok's American facing docs. ie: 
            -TikTok stated that an SPS in the top 80th precentile is 4/5.
            -My own equation (80 * 0.025) rounds the top 80th percentile to 4.5/5. 
      For the sake of my hypothesis (which again, shouldn't be taken for gospel!!!!!!!) I'm just assuming a margin of error of ~0.5 in the final scores I calculate.

Note that the _actual_ equation likely includes metrics that TikTok doesn't disclose publically. I supplemented TikTok's docs with these indenpendent reports from sellers on Zhihu who (allegedly) reverse engineered the score:

I'm also assuming the score calculation is analogous to Douyin's store rating model (DSR), which has been thoroughly analyzed and corroborated by people working at Byte/Douyin since its inception in 2020. I've translated these docs on DSR as part of my analysis:
