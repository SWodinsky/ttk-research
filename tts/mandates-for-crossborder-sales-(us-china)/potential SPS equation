Sample formula based documents + links written by TikTok for domestic/cross-border sellers targeting US shoppers. 
Note that the _actual_ equation likely includes metrics that TikTok doesn't disclose publically. I supplemented TikTok's docs with these indenpendent reports from sellers on Zhihu who (allegedly) reverse engineered the score:
    * https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/656154669
    
  
  
TikTok notes that SPS is a score given out of 5. A seller with SPS = 4/5 is performing better than 80% of other sellers targeting the US
