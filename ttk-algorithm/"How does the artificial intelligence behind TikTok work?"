KEY TAKEAWAYS (translated): 

1. TikTok’s secret weapon for reading people’s thoughts is:
    a) Algorithm experiment platform: Engineers conduct experiments on a mixture of multiple machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and convolutional neural networks, and then run tests (A/B tests) and make adjustments.
    b) Extensive classification and labeling: The model is based on user engagement, such as watch time, swipes, and commonly likes or shares (what people do is often a subconscious reflection). The number of user features, vectors, and categories exceeds that of most recommender systems in the world, and they are growing all the time.
    c) User feedback engine: Update the model after retrieving user feedback for multiple iterations. The experience management platform is built on top of this engine and ultimately improves upon these flaws and suggestions.

To solve the cold-start problem in recommendations, a recall strategy is used. It's about selecting thousands of candidates from tens of millions of videos that have proven to be popular and of high quality.
At the same time, some AI work has been moved to the client for ultra-fast responses. This includes real-time training, modeling and inference on the device. The client uses machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite or ByteNN.
